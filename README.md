You can obtain alternative data from the Brazilian Market using this library

Examples:
* Indexes, such as IBOV, IFIX but also S&P 500
* Economy sectors of companies listed in the Brazilian stock exchange


```python
from tradingcomdados import alternative_data as ad

# General function
ad.index_composition()

# Obtaining composition of IBOV
ad.index_composition('ibov')

# Obtaining composition of S&P500
ad.index_composition('sp500')

# Obtaining sectors of Brazilian companies listed at B3
ad.get_sectors()

# Obtaining sector of a particular company
ad.get_sectors('PETR')

# Notice we are not using numbers at the end of tickers
ad.get_sectors('VALE')
